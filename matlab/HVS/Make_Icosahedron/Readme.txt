The main program is make_icosahedron.

It is used to make hemispherical domes
or full spherical icosahedrons.

The icosahedrons made by this program are 
classified as class 1 type 2 frequency f.

The freuqency is how many times the struts 
of the base icosahedron have been subdivided.  
f=2 is similar to a soccer ball.

A full sphere of f=10 has 4002 nodes.
